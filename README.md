###Getting started
Verify that it's a bug of sufficient importance and that it's not due to a lack of feature implementation.
Due to the current state of the project, very small issues are not of great importance to the team and they tend to clog up the bug lists. Additionally, problems which are clearly the result of a lack of implementation at the present time (such as the land of the dead access) and not due to a bug in the RoR code are not of interest to us.

Verify that it's not been posted before.
You can search the bugtracker for keywords in order to verify that the bug you're posting wasn't already reported. Please do so to avoid creating work for the bugtracker's managers. A closed report means only one thing – the devs consider the report either to be fixed or false. this does not means that the report was consumed by Chaos and lost forever. If you have something to say about a closed report, comment on it, we'll take a look and reopen it if needed. Do not create duplicate reports stating "I created / noticed report ABC, and it got closed, but the problem is still here because X and Y".

Do not post well-known issues that are within the realm of game / technical support.

Supply as much evidence as possible.
This depends upon the type of bug. If you're reporting an issue which is known by many players, you won't need to provide as much evidence. However, if you're reporting a bug in a core, often-used aspect of the game, which could be met with disbelief from the staff, please ensure that you provide the appropriate evidence, be it in screenshot, video format or replay

Do not bump.
The bugtracker is not a forum in which old threads get buried by the new ones – we regularly look through all reports, both old and new. Creating a duplicate report because the existing one "is too old" is pointless and so is "bumping" old reports with meaningless comments.

If contradicted by staff, don't press the point without evidence.
If a developer or staff member asserts that a certain feature of the game is working as intended, and you happen to disagree, please acquire proof which demonstrates that the staff member in question is incorrect before posting in the issue topic again.
Do not whine for fixes.
The bugtracker is an instrument of the devs. As a player, you may report problems there and provide clarification and assistance with testing if needed. Do not ask "when this will be fixed" or "anything new on this?" (these questions can be asked by devs but for different reasons) – if devs are not fixing something then there is a solid reason for that and when they fix something it will be mentioned in the report or patchnotes. Do not post with "Please fix" in your report either.

Use the relevant keywords and spell them correctly.
This is vital, as it allows both our managers to easily collate and deal with duplicate reports, and other players to effectively search for duplicate issues. Use ability, tank, item, location names when needed to aid with this.
